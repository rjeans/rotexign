## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how modern engines precisely control ignition timing at thousands of RPM? Or how a simple Arduino can manage microsecond-precision timing for a high-performance two-stroke engine? This blog post dives deep into the **rotexign** project - a production-ready Arduino-based ignition timing controller designed for the Rotax 787 two-stroke engine.

This isn't just another hobby Arduino project. It's a fully-featured engine management system with sophisticated state machines, predictive algorithms, and multiple layers of safety protection. Let's explore what makes this controller tick (literally, at 0.5μs resolution!).

## Project Overview

The rotexign controller transforms an Arduino Uno/Nano (ATmega328P) into a precision ignition timing system capable of:

- **Microsecond-precision timing** using hardware Timer1 interrupts
- **Intelligent state management** with a four-state engine control system
- **Adaptive timing modes** that automatically adjust based on RPM
- **Comprehensive safety features** including rev limiter, duty cycle protection, and timeout detection
- **RPM prediction** using Holt's double exponential smoothing

### Why Build This?

Modern ignition systems need to:
1. Fire spark plugs at precisely the right moment (advance timing)
2. Energize the coil for the right duration (dwell time)
3. Adapt timing as RPM changes
4. Protect the engine and components from damage
5. Handle real-world noise and signal variations

The rotexign controller accomplishes all of this using the ATmega328P's hardware capabilities and intelligent software architecture.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Hardware Timer Architecture

At the heart of the system is **Timer1**, configured with a prescaler of /8 on a 16MHz clock, giving us a **0.5μs tick resolution**. This provides the precision needed for accurate timing control:

```
Timer1 Resolution: 16MHz / 8 = 2MHz = 0.5μs per tick
Maximum Timer Range: 65535 ticks = 32.768ms
```

This resolution is crucial because at 6000 RPM:
- Each engine revolution takes only **10ms**
- With 2 trigger pulses per revolution (180° apart), each period is **5ms**
- We need to schedule events with sub-millisecond accuracy

### Interrupt-Driven Precision

The controller uses **external interrupt INT0** (pin D2) to capture trigger pulses from the crankshaft sensor. When a falling edge is detected:

1. **Immediate Response**: Hardware interrupt captures Timer1 count with zero latency
2. **Period Calculation**: Time between triggers gives us RPM
3. **State Updates**: Engine state machine processes the trigger
4. **Timing Calculation**: Next spark timing is computed
5. **Event Scheduling**: Dwell and spark events are scheduled using Timer1 compare interrupts

Direct port manipulation (bypassing `digitalWrite()`) ensures minimal latency:

```cpp
// Coil on (start dwell)
PORTD &= ~_BV(PORTD3);  // ~62ns execution time

// Coil off (fire spark)  
PORTD |= _BV(PORTD3);   // ~62ns execution time
```

### The Engine State Machine

One of the most sophisticated aspects of this controller is its **four-state engine management system**. This isn't just about detecting RPM - it's about understanding what the engine is doing and responding appropriately.

#### State 1: STOPPED
- Initial state when system powers up
- Ignition is disabled for safety
- Waits for both starter signal AND trigger pulses
- Validates trigger stability before proceeding

#### State 2: READY
- Engine has stable triggers but isn't running yet
- Still no spark output (safety first!)
- Monitors for cranking conditions
- Implements 200ms debounce to prevent false starts

#### State 3: CRANKING
- Starter is active, RPM in cranking range (200-800 RPM)
- **Spark enabled with 0° advance** (TDC timing for starting)
- Full timing calculations active
- Waits for RPM to rise above idle threshold

#### State 4: RUNNING
- Normal engine operation mode
- **Full advance curve active** (0° to 25° based on RPM)
- Predictive RPM calculations using Holt's method
- Automatic return to CRANKING if RPM drops

#### Automatic Transitions

The state machine intelligently transitions based on:
- **Starter signal** (D5 input from starter motor circuit)
- **RPM thresholds** (200, 800, 1100 RPM boundaries)
- **Trigger timeout** (500ms without trigger → STOPPED)
- **Debounce delays** (200ms for state stability)

This creates a robust, fail-safe system that handles real-world conditions like:
- False triggers during cranking
- Backfiring during startup
- Stalling scenarios
- Power-on conditions

### Three Adaptive Timing Modes

As RPM increases, the time available to schedule dwell and spark events decreases. The controller automatically selects between three timing modes:

#### Mode 1: TIMING_SAME_LOBE (Low RPM: <2000 RPM)

At low RPM, there's plenty of time in each 180° period. The controller:
- Schedules dwell start in the current period
- Waits 3ms (dwell time)
- Fires spark at calculated advance

**Example at 1500 RPM:**
- Period = 20ms
- Advance = 9.1°
- Dwell starts after trigger + delay
- Spark fires 3ms later

![Timing Waveforms - Same Lobe](../analysis/timing_waveforms.png)

#### Mode 2: TIMING_PREVIOUS_LOBE (Medium RPM: 2000-4000 RPM)

As RPM increases, we need more advance, but there isn't enough time in one period. Solution:
- Schedule dwell in the **previous 180° period**
- Add one full period to the delay calculation
- Maintain full 3ms dwell time

**Example at 4500 RPM:**
- Period = 6.7ms
- Advance = 14.3°
- Dwell starts 1.448ms **before** next trigger (in previous period)
- Spark fires 2.7ms after the next trigger

This is the "magic" that allows proper advance at medium RPM!

#### Mode 3: TIMING_IMMEDIATE (High RPM: >4000 RPM)

At very high RPM, the calculated dwell start has already passed. The controller:
- Starts dwell **immediately** when trigger occurs
- Maintains original spark timing
- Reduces effective dwell time to fit available window

This ensures spark occurs even when we can't achieve full dwell.

### Duty Cycle Protection

The ignition coil has a maximum duty cycle (40% in this application) to prevent overheating. At high RPM with long dwell times, this becomes critical:

```
Duty Cycle = (Dwell Time / Period) × 100%

At 6000 RPM with 3ms dwell:
Period = 5ms
Duty Cycle = (3ms / 5ms) × 100% = 60% ⚠️ TOO HIGH!
```

The controller automatically reduces dwell time at high RPM to maintain safe duty cycle:

![Dwell vs RPM Analysis](../doc/dwell_vs_rpm_40pct.png)

### Predictive RPM with Holt's Method

Real engines don't run at constant RPM - they accelerate, decelerate, and have cycle-to-cycle variations. The controller uses **Holt's double exponential smoothing** to predict the next cycle's RPM:

```
Level_t = α × RPM_measured + (1-α) × (Level_t-1 + Trend_t-1)
Trend_t = β × (Level_t - Level_t-1) + (1-β) × Trend_t-1
Predicted_RPM = Level_t + Trend_t
```

This provides:
- **Smoother timing** during acceleration/deceleration
- **Better advance accuracy** by accounting for RPM changes
- **Reduced timing jitter** from noise

The smoothing factors (α=0.3, β=0.1) are tuned for two-stroke engine dynamics.

## Safety Features

Safety isn't an afterthought - it's built into every layer:

### 1. Rev Limiter (7500 RPM)
- Hard cut at 7500 RPM
- 250 RPM hysteresis prevents oscillation
- Disables spark output completely when exceeded

### 2. Duty Cycle Protection (40% max)
- Monitors coil on-time vs engine period
- Automatically reduces dwell at high RPM
- Prevents coil overheating and damage

### 3. Noise Filtering
- Rejects trigger pulses with >30% period change
- Prevents false triggers from electrical noise
- 748 noise triggers filtered in testing (see analysis below)

### 4. Relay Protection System
- Safety relay (D4) keeps coil grounded at startup
- Requires trigger signal stable HIGH for 1 second before arming
- Prevents accidental sparks during system startup

### 5. Trigger Timeout Detection
- 500ms timeout without trigger → automatic STOPPED state
- Detects stalled or stopped engine
- Safely disables ignition output

### 6. Startup Protection
- Requires 2 stable triggers before enabling ignition
- Validates trigger period consistency
- Prevents operation with unstable sensor signals

## Real-World Performance Analysis

The system includes comprehensive analysis tools that validate timing accuracy across the RPM range:

### Noise Filtering Performance

At 549 RPM, the system successfully filtered **748 noise triggers** while maintaining stable ignition:

![Noise Filtering Waveform](../analysis/timing_waveforms.png)

The bottom panel shows how the noise filter rejects triggers with period changes >30%, ensuring only valid triggers generate sparks.

### Timing Mode Transitions

The controller smoothly transitions between timing modes:

![Previous Lobe Switch Analysis](../doc/previous_lobe_switch_plot.png)

The transition occurs at approximately **1825 RPM**, where same-lobe timing no longer provides sufficient window for dwell + advance.

### Measured Timing Accuracy

Testing across the RPM range shows excellent timing accuracy:

| RPM Range | Timing Mode | Target Advance | Measured Advance | Error |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| 1499 | Same Lobe | 9.1° | 9.1° | 0.0° |
| 2100 | Instant Dwell | 12.4° | 12.4° | 0.0° |
| 4500 | Previous Lobe | 14.3° | 14.3° | 0.0° |
| 6000 | Previous Lobe | 18.0° | ~18.0° | <0.5° |

## Testing and Simulation

The project includes a complete **Wokwi simulation environment** with a physics-based pulse generator that models:

- Realistic engine acceleration profile

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Hardware Timing is Critical

Early versions used software-only timing (`micros()` checks in main loop). This introduced jitter and missed events. Moving to hardware Timer1 compare interrupts provided:
- **Deterministic timing** independent of code execution
- **Zero-jitter event scheduling**
- **Microsecond precision** without polling

### 2. State Machines Prevent Edge Cases

The four-state engine management system eliminated numerous edge cases that plagued simpler implementations:
- No more sparks during cranking preparation
- Proper handling of stall conditions
- Clean startup/shutdown sequences
- Predictable behavior in all scenarios

### 3. Predictive Algorithms Smooth Performance

Holt's method made a significant difference in timing stability:
- Reduced advance jitter during acceleration
- Better handling of cycle-to-cycle RPM variations
- Smoother overall engine operation

### 4. Safety Features Must Be Comprehensive

Multiple layers of protection catch different failure modes:
- Rev limiter prevents over-speed
- Duty cycle protection prevents coil damage
- Timeout detection handles sensor failure
- Noise filtering prevents false triggers
- Relay system prevents startup accidents

No single protection is sufficient - defense in depth is essential.

### 5. Simulation and Analysis Tools are Essential

The Wokwi simulation environment and Python analysis tools were invaluable:
- Catch timing bugs before hardware testing
- Validate advance curves mathematically
- Visualize timing waveforms like an oscilloscope
- Iterate quickly without risk to hardware

Invest time in tooling - it pays off exponentially.
