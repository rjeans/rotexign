- Configurable RPM sweep testing (200-8000 RPM)
- Real-time timing curve generation
- VCD export for detailed analysis
- All operational scenarios validated

### **Bench Testing Procedure**
1. **Wokwi Validation**: Test timing curves and RPM ranges in simulation first
2. **Function Generator**: Verify trigger response and timing accuracy  
3. **Oscilloscope**: Validate dwell timing (D10 marker) and spark output (D9)
4. **VCD Analysis**: Use `python3 timing_analyzer.py test.vcd` for complete analysis and plots

## Code Layout
- `rotexign.ino`: Main firmware (INT0 trigger, Timer1 timebase, dwell/spark scheduling, safety, serial).
- `TIMING_LOGIC.md`: **Complete timing algorithm documentation** including previous-lobe scheduling and bug fixes.
- `doc/IgnitionControllerDesignNotes.md`: Architecture, hardware, algorithms, and constraints.
- `doc/TestingCalibrationGuide.md`: Bench, engine integration, and tuning steps.
- `doc/AgentDesignNotes.md`: Source of truth for design decisions (wiring, timing, limits).

## Safety
- Remove plugs for initial checks; use shielded wiring and proper drivers.
- Always test on the bench before live engine operation.

## Changes After First Round Testing

These updates address the issues documented in `doc/FirstTestResults.md`:

- D9 polarity: Added `COIL_ACTIVE_HIGH` (default `true`) to match the 1GN-1A smart coil (5V rising edge starts dwell, falling edge fires). Set to `false` only if using an external inverting driver.
- Triple-pulse artifact: Timer1 compare matches are now one-shot; interrupts arm only when scheduled and disable themselves after firing, avoiding stale re-fires.
- Noise-induced retriggers: INT0 ISR uses Timer1 tick deltas (0.5 µs resolution) to reject pulses closer than 0.5 ms (glitches) and 2.0 ms (spark-noise guard). No `millis()` calls in ISR.
- D10 meaning: Repurposed as a dwell marker — HIGH while the coil is charging, LOW at spark — for clean scope validation.
- Safe startup: On boot and when signal is lost, the coil is off and no compare matches are armed. Relay outputs (pins 3 and 4) are explicitly configured and driven.
- Serial robustness: Replaced Arduino `String` parsing with a fixed buffer to avoid heap fragmentation.

## **Detailed Performance Analysis**

### **Timing Curves Explained**

The ignition controller uses three timing references:

**Actual BTDC** - What the Arduino actually delivers
- Measured from VCD analysis of real spark timing
- Shows the controller's precision and accuracy

**Safe BTDC** - Conservative timing curve (default)
- Maximum 15 degrees advance to prevent engine knock/damage
- Recommended for initial setup and high-stress conditions
- Prioritizes engine protection over maximum power

**Performance BTDC** - Aggressive timing curve  
- Up to 20 degrees advance for maximum power output
- Only use with premium fuel and proper tuning
- Requires careful monitoring for knock/detonation

### **Full RPM Range Analysis** (from `wokwi/wokwi-logic-analysis.txt`)

| RPM Range | Count | Actual Advance | Safe Target | Perf Target | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 500-999 | 145 events | 4.6 deg BTDC | 4.7 deg BTDC | 4.7 deg BTDC | Perfect |
| 1000-1499 | 240 events | 7.5 deg BTDC | 7.6 deg BTDC | 7.6 deg BTDC | Perfect |
| 1500-1999 | 339 events | 10.1 deg BTDC | 10.5 deg BTDC | 10.5 deg BTDC | Excellent |
| 2000-2499 | 434 events | 12.7 deg BTDC | 12.8 deg BTDC | 14.0 deg BTDC | Safe Mode |
| 2500-2999 | 531 events | 14.1 deg BTDC | 14.2 deg BTDC | 18.0 deg BTDC | Safe Mode |
| 3000-3499 | 667 events | 14.8 deg BTDC | 15.0 deg BTDC | 20.0 deg BTDC | Safe Mode |
| 6500-6999 | 1627 events | -4.8 deg BTDC | 12.2 deg BTDC | 17.2 deg BTDC | Rev Limiter |

**Key Observations:**
- **Perfect accuracy** below 2000 RPM (+/-0.1 degree error)
- **Safe mode active** above 2000 RPM (as configured)
- **Rev limiter engaged** above 6500 RPM (negative advance = spark cut)
- **27,162 total triggers** processed without errors

### **What Does "BTDC" Mean?**

**BTDC = Before Top Dead Center** - This measures when the spark fires relative to piston position:

**Higher BTDC** (more advance):
- Spark fires earlier in compression stroke
- Gives fuel/air mixture more time to burn
- Increases power but risks engine knock
- Example: 15 deg BTDC = spark 15 degrees before piston reaches top

**Lower BTDC** (less advance): 
- Spark fires closer to top dead center
- Safer for engine but less efficient
- Example: 5 deg BTDC = spark only 5 degrees before piston reaches top

**Negative BTDC** (retarded timing):
- Spark fires AFTER top dead center
- Used by rev limiter to cut power safely
- Example: -5 deg BTDC = spark 5 degrees after piston passes top

### **Why Different Curves Matter**

**Safe Curve (Default)**: 
- Like driving conservatively - protects your engine
- Works with regular fuel, high temperatures, heavy loads
- Slightly less power but maximum reliability

**Performance Curve**: 
- Like sport mode - maximum power output
- Requires premium fuel and careful monitoring
- Risk of engine knock if not properly tuned

The controller automatically uses **Safe curve** as tested, ensuring reliable operation across all conditions.

*Live capture showing trigger input (blue), spark output (red), and dwell marker (green) during 10-second window. Note the precise timing relationship between trigger pulses and spark delivery.*

#### **Focused Timing Analysis**

The enhanced timing plots below show actual advance angles with color-coded quality indicators:
- 🟢 **Green**: Good timing (>10° BTDC)
- 🟡 **Orange**: Poor timing (0-10° BTDC) 
- 🔴 **Red**: Critical timing (negative BTDC - after TDC)

![Low RPM Timing](wokwi/timing_800rpm.svg)
*800 RPM: +4.5° BTDC (POOR) - Insufficient advance at low RPM*

![Medium RPM Timing](wokwi/timing_2000rpm.svg) 
*2000 RPM: +13.5° BTDC (GOOD) - Optimal timing in mid-range*

![High RPM Timing](wokwi/timing_5500rpm.svg)
*5500 RPM: +2.0° BTDC (POOR) - Severely retarded timing at high RPM*

![Very High RPM Timing](wokwi/timing_6500rpm.svg)
*6500 RPM: -2.0° BTDC (POOR) - Critical timing after TDC indicating rev limiter activation*

**Timing Quality Analysis**: The plots reveal timing accuracy issues at low and high RPM ranges, with the 6500 RPM plot showing negative advance (spark after TDC) indicating rev limiter engagement or timing calculation errors requiring investigation.
