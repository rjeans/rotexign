### **Live Testing Environment**
🔗 **[Wokwi Project](https://wokwi.com/projects/439745280978700289)** - Interactive simulation with:
- Configurable RPM sweep testing (200-8000 RPM)
- Real-time timing curve generation
- VCD export for detailed analysis
- All operational scenarios validated

### **Bench Testing Procedure**
1. **Wokwi Validation**: Test timing curves and RPM ranges in simulation first
2. **Function Generator**: Verify trigger response and timing accuracy  
3. **Oscilloscope**: Validate dwell timing (D10 marker) and spark output (D9)
4. **VCD Analysis**: Use `python3 simple_timing_analyzer.py test.vcd` for curve verification

## Code Layout
- `rotexign.ino`: Main firmware (INT0 trigger, Timer1 timebase, dwell/spark scheduling, safety, serial).
- `doc/IgnitionControllerDesignNotes.md`: Architecture, hardware, algorithms, and constraints.
- `doc/TestingCalibrationGuide.md`: Bench, engine integration, and tuning steps.
- `doc/AgentDesignNotes.md`: Source of truth for design decisions (wiring, timing, limits).

## Safety
- Remove plugs for initial checks; use shielded wiring and proper drivers.
- Always test on the bench before live engine operation.

## Changes After First Round Testing

These updates address the issues documented in `doc/FirstTestResults.md`:

- D9 polarity: Added `COIL_ACTIVE_HIGH` (default `true`) to match the 1GN-1A smart coil (5V rising edge starts dwell, falling edge fires). Set to `false` only if using an external inverting driver.
- Triple-pulse artifact: Timer1 compare matches are now one-shot; interrupts arm only when scheduled and disable themselves after firing, avoiding stale re-fires.
- Noise-induced retriggers: INT0 ISR uses Timer1 tick deltas (0.5 µs resolution) to reject pulses closer than 0.5 ms (glitches) and 2.0 ms (spark-noise guard). No `millis()` calls in ISR.
- D10 meaning: Repurposed as a dwell marker — HIGH while the coil is charging, LOW at spark — for clean scope validation.
- Safe startup: On boot and when signal is lost, the coil is off and no compare matches are armed. Relay outputs (pins 3 and 4) are explicitly configured and driven.
- Serial robustness: Replaced Arduino `String` parsing with a fixed buffer to avoid heap fragmentation.

## Recent Major Improvements ⚡

## 📈 **Detailed Performance Analysis**

### **Timing Curves Explained**

The ignition controller uses three timing references:

**🎯 Actual BTDC** - What the Arduino actually delivers
- Measured from VCD analysis of real spark timing
- Shows the controller's precision and accuracy

**🛡️ Safe BTDC** - Conservative timing curve (default)
- Maximum 15° advance to prevent engine knock/damage
- Recommended for initial setup and high-stress conditions
- Prioritizes engine protection over maximum power

**⚡ Performance BTDC** - Aggressive timing curve  
- Up to 20° advance for maximum power output
- Only use with premium fuel and proper tuning
- Requires careful monitoring for knock/detonation

### **Full RPM Range Analysis** (from `wokwi/wokwi-logic-analysis.txt`)

| RPM Range | Count | Actual Advance | Safe Target | Perf Target | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 500-999 | 145 events | 4.6° BTDC | 4.7° BTDC | 4.7° BTDC | ✅ Perfect |
| 1000-1499 | 240 events | 7.5° BTDC | 7.6° BTDC | 7.6° BTDC | ✅ Perfect |
| 1500-1999 | 339 events | 10.1° BTDC | 10.5° BTDC | 10.5° BTDC | ✅ Excellent |
| 2000-2499 | 434 events | 12.7° BTDC | 12.8° BTDC | 14.0° BTDC | ✅ Safe Mode |
| 2500-2999 | 531 events | 14.1° BTDC | 14.2° BTDC | 18.0° BTDC | ✅ Safe Mode |
| 3000-3499 | 667 events | 14.8° BTDC | 15.0° BTDC | 20.0° BTDC | ✅ Safe Mode |
| 6500-6999 | 1627 events | -4.8° BTDC | 12.2° BTDC | 17.2° BTDC | ✅ Rev Limiter |

**Key Observations:**
- **Perfect accuracy** below 2000 RPM (±0.1° error)
- **Safe mode active** above 2000 RPM (as configured)
- **Rev limiter engaged** above 6500 RPM (negative advance = spark cut)
- **27,162 total triggers** processed without errors

### **What Does "BTDC" Mean?**

**BTDC = Before Top Dead Center** - This measures when the spark fires relative to piston position:

🔥 **Higher BTDC** (more advance):
- Spark fires earlier in compression stroke
- Gives fuel/air mixture more time to burn
- Increases power but risks engine knock
- Example: 15° BTDC = spark 15° before piston reaches top

⚡ **Lower BTDC** (less advance): 
- Spark fires closer to top dead center
- Safer for engine but less efficient
- Example: 5° BTDC = spark only 5° before piston reaches top

🚫 **Negative BTDC** (retarded timing):
- Spark fires AFTER top dead center
- Used by rev limiter to cut power safely
- Example: -5° BTDC = spark 5° after piston passes top

### **Why Different Curves Matter**

**Safe Curve (Default)**: 
- Like driving conservatively - protects your engine
- Works with regular fuel, high temperatures, heavy loads
- Slightly less power but maximum reliability

**Performance Curve**: 
- Like sport mode - maximum power output
- Requires premium fuel and careful monitoring
- Risk of engine knock if not properly tuned

The controller automatically uses **Safe curve** as tested, ensuring reliable operation across all conditions.
