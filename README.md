# rotexign ‚Äî Arduino Ignition Controller

Arduino-based ignition timing controller for the Rotax 787 two-stroke engine. This implementation uses interrupt-driven timing control with a deferred processing architecture for precise dwell and spark scheduling.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Status**: Hardware prototype with known timing bugs - missing sparks and acceleration errors

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated ignition timing controller using an Arduino Uno/Nano (ATmega328P). The system uses hardware timer interrupts and optimized tick-based calculations to achieve microsecond-precision timing control suitable for high-performance two-stroke engines.

## Key Features

### Core Timing Engine
- **Hardware Timer-Based**: Uses Timer1 with 0.5Œºs resolution (prescaler /8 at 16MHz)
- **Deferred Processing**: External interrupt (INT0) captures timing, main loop processes events
- **Ring Buffer**: Buffered event system prevents missed triggers during processing
- **Direct Port Control**: Bypasses Arduino digitalRead/Write for minimal latency
- **Tick-Based Math**: All calculations in timer ticks to avoid floating-point

### Timing Control
- **Adaptive Advance Curve**: 201-point interpolated timing map stored in PROGMEM
- **Previous-Lobe Timing**: Always uses previous lobe for timing (one full period delay)
- **Precision Dwell Control**: 3ms target with 40% duty cycle protection
- **Two-Stage Scheduling**: Separate dwell start and spark fire events
- **RPM Range**: Designed for 800-8000 RPM operation

### Safety Features
- **Rev Limiter**: Hard cut at 7000 RPM with immediate ignition disable
- **Startup Protection**: 3-trigger stabilization before enabling ignition
- **Duty Cycle Protection**: Prevents coil overheating at high RPM
- **Input Pulse Filtering**: 30% period change rejection to filter noise
- **Relay Protection**: D4 relay keeps coil grounded until D2 is stable HIGH for 1 second
- **Clean Initialization**: All outputs start in safe state

## Hardware Configuration

### Pinout
| Pin | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| D2 | Trigger Input (INT0) | Falling edge trigger from crank sensor (47¬∞ BTDC) |
| D3 | Ignition Output | Coil control (HIGH‚ÜíLOW = start dwell, LOW‚ÜíHIGH = fire spark) |
| D4 | Safety Relay | Relay control (HIGH = armed/open, LOW = safe/closed at startup) |

### Engine Parameters
- **Trigger Configuration**: 2 pulses per revolution (2 lobes, 180¬∞ apart)
- **Trigger Position**: 47¬∞ BTDC
- **Coil Type**: Smart coil with 3ms dwell requirement at 12V
- **Maximum Duty Cycle**: 40% to prevent coil damage

## Implementation Details

### Current Architecture

The controller uses a deferred processing architecture with event buffering:

```
Trigger (INT0) ‚Üí Buffer Event ‚Üí Main Loop ‚Üí Schedule Dwell ‚Üí Fire Spark
```

1. **Trigger ISR** (`INT0_vect`):
   - Captures Timer1 count immediately for precise timing
   - Filters trigger pulses to reject 30% period changes (noise rejection)
   - Waits for 3-trigger stabilization before enabling ignition
   - Buffers timing events in ring buffer for main loop processing
   - Minimal processing in ISR to prevent missed triggers

2. **Main Loop Processing**:
   - Processes buffered timing events when engine is waiting
   - Calculates RPM, advance angle, and timing delays
   - Schedules dwell start using Timer1 Compare A interrupt
   - Handles relay arming logic and diagnostics

3. **Timer1 Compare A ISR** (`TIMER1_COMPA_vect`):
   - **State DWELL_SCHEDULED**: Start dwell (LOW), schedule spark
   - **State DWELLING**: Fire spark (HIGH), return to waiting
   - Implements two-stage scheduling for precise timing control

### Timing Calculations

All timing uses integer math with Timer1 ticks (0.5Œºs resolution):

```cpp
// RPM from period ticks (avoids floating point) 
rpm = 60,000,000 / (period_ticks * 2)

// Advance angle from 201-point curve (PROGMEM)
advance_tenths = get_advance_angle_tenths(rpm)

// Spark delay calculation
delay_angle_tenths = 470 - advance_tenths  // 47¬∞ BTDC - advance
delay_ticks = (delay_angle_tenths * period_ticks + 900) / 1800

// Dwell timing (always previous lobe)
dwell_delay_ticks = (period_ticks + spark_delay_ticks) - dwell_ticks
```

### Timing Curve Generation

The 201-point timing curve in PROGMEM is generated through a sophisticated smoothing process:

1. **Base Points**: Starts with 9 key RPM/advance points defining the desired curve shape
2. **Cubic Interpolation**: Generates 200 intermediate points using cubic spline interpolation
3. **Savitzky-Golay Filtering**: Applies polynomial smoothing to remove discontinuities
4. **Lookup Table Generation**: Creates final 201 points at 40 RPM intervals (0-8000 RPM)
5. **Fixed-Point Conversion**: Stores values as tenths of degrees (√ó10) for integer math

This process (`analysis/smooth_timing_curve.py`) ensures:
- Smooth transitions without abrupt changes
- Optimal engine performance across the RPM range
- Efficient storage in limited PROGMEM space
- Fast runtime lookup with linear interpolation between points

### Previous-Lobe Timing

The controller uses previous-lobe timing exclusively for all RPM ranges:

- **Always Previous-Lobe**: Adds one full period to dwell delay calculation  
- **Benefit**: Provides maximum dwell time window at all RPM
- **Trade-off**: Uses more recent RPM data but requires larger timing buffer

## Known Issues

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues Requiring Resolution**

### 1. Missing Sparks
- **Symptom**: Intermittent spark failures, especially during steady-state operation
- **Suspected Cause**: Event buffer overflow or timing race conditions
- **Impact**: Engine misfiring and poor performance
- **Location**: `rotexign.ino:516-528` event processing in main loop

### 2. Timing Errors on Acceleration  
- **Symptom**: Incorrect timing advance during RPM changes
- **Suspected Cause**: Using stale period data from ring buffer during acceleration
- **Impact**: Poor throttle response and potential engine damage
- **Location**: `rotexign.ino:520-527` period calculation and scheduling

### 3. Deferred Processing Latency
- **Symptom**: Variable delay between trigger and dwell start
- **Root Cause**: Main loop processing creates timing uncertainty
- **Impact**: Inconsistent ignition timing
- **Location**: Ring buffer architecture throughout main loop

## Previous Testing Status

The controller was previously extensively tested in Wokwi simulation:

üîó **[Live Simulation Project](https://wokwi.com/projects/439745280978700289)**

**Previous Results**: 99.9% timing accuracy within ¬±0.1¬∞ across 14,533 measurements

**Current Status**: Hardware implementation shows timing bugs not present in simulation, likely due to:
- Real-world timing constraints not modeled in simulation
- Race conditions between ISR and main loop processing  
- Ring buffer management issues under varying load conditions
